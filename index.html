      <h1>About me</h1>
      <img src="/bilder/PROF 3.jpg" alt="dud in bout">
      <p>I am 38 years old and have always liked Data, IT and Gaming but now I would like to learn a bit more about coding websites to see if I can get a job in that field.
         I have extensive experience from many other subjects and know a little about a lot.</p>
      <h2>My free time</h2>
      <img src="/bilder/reise bÃ¥t 1.jpg" alt="dud in bout">
      <p>In my free time, I like to travel to a place I haven't been before that has something exciting to see and something new to experience.
         I also try to go swimming, climb or have a ride on my road bike 2-3 times a week.</p>
